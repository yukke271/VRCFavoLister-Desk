Please be aware of the possibility of banning your account due to excessive function calls, etc., as it uses an API that is not officially supported, and use at your own risk. <br />

以下、VRChat APIの使用に関するVRChatチームの公式な回答です。<br />
Below is the official response from the VRChat team regarding the use of the VRChat API.
```
Use of the API using applications other than the approved methods (website, VRChat application) are not officially supported. You may use the API for your own application, but keep these guidelines in mind:
● We do not provide documentation or support for the API.
● Do not make queries to the API more than once per 60 seconds.
● Abuse of the API may result in account termination.
● Access to API endpoints may break at any given time, with no warning.
```
